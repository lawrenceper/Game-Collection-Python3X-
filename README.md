# Game-Collection-Python3X-

This is a collection of text-based games that I wrote in Python 3.X. These games are open source, making it possible for beginner Python users to learn from my code. The games have been optimized for screen readers (E.G. by using sleep in Python).

## how to run the games

If you are a screen reader user, I recommend running the games inside of a terminal or command prompt. To run the bingo caller game, for example, you would type python3 bingocaller.py.

##  Windows users

If you are using windows, you may need to use a tool like unix2dos. This is because I wrote the games in a Linux environment, and Windows processes newline characters differently than Unix-like systems. Users on Linux, E.G. Ubuntu, or on a Mac do not need to worry about this.

## Screen Readers

I wrote these games on a raspberry pi, and tested them using the orca screen reader. Different screen readers may read became contact differently depending on the operating system and other assistive technology in use.
