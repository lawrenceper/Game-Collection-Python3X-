# Game-Collection-Python3X-

This is a collection of text-based games that I wrote in Python 3.X. These games are open source, making it possible for beginner Python users to learn from my code. The games have been optimized for screen readers (E.G. by using sleep in Python).
## how to run the games

If you are a screen reader user, I recommend running the games inside of a terminal or command prompt. To run the bingo caller game, for example, you would type python3 bingocaller.py.
